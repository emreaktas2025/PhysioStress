# PhysioStress: AI-Powered Wearable Stress Detection

## Overview

PhysioStress is an AI-powered pipeline for wearable stress detection using multimodal physiological signals from the WESAD dataset. It processes signals like ECG, EDA, and respiration to extract features for stress classification.

## Dataset

The [WESAD dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/WESAD) was used in this project. Due to its size, it is not included in this repository.
